<h1>WVU Enrollment Problem</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In 2014, West Virginia University president Gordon Gee
pledged to increase enrollment of the West Virginia University
system, including the main, WVU Tech, and Potomac State
College campuses, to 40,000 students. As of the Fall 2023
semester, system-wide enrollment stood at 26,791 with
24,200 of those students in Morgantown. Given the
challenges facing higher education and shrinking college-age
population, there are questions regarding the feasibility of Geeâ€™s enrollment target. In this assignment, I will calculate the annual rate of growth needed for WVU system enrollment to reach a specified target.
